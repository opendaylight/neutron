      "message": "because I wanted to take this step by step.. as-is right now just depending on the API won\u0027t work; that will take c/69541 (OK for you?). This doesn\u0027t even work yet with a direct bundle dependency without an indirection through an additional feature, and I\u0027m very puzzled as to why - bugs me that I cannot understand this.  So I would like to keep this simple, get it working - and then extend this in that sense, so this coming next, in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/69542/, once I can figure why the hell this isn\u0027t working like this.",
