      "message": "actually.. I\u0027m mixing up 2 things here. As long as \tthe northbound-api bundle has a dependency to the aaa-shiro, and this odl-neutron-northbound-api has a dependency to odl-aaa-shiro, there is no need need for a dependency to odl-aaa-web.  I do have plans to extend the Web API and let a bundle such as this one (or restconf) not have to depend on the Shiro implementation details of AAA, and when I get to that then this will be needed (and the odl-aaa-shiro dependency here and the northbound-api dependency to aaa-shiro will be removed) - but not yet.",
