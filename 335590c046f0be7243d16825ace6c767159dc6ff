      "message": "I believe this will result in a ds read, right? This will have perf impact. I\u0027d prefer if we added Tom\u0027s DataTree cache in here to avoid datastore reads. Ideally, we should cache when data is written. May also want to ignore read altogheter by relying only on cache, but that will likely be needed in check for ifNotExists when checking for delete dependencies.",

      "message": "Correct.  But this change was supposed to be \u0027just\u0027 about illustrating how to replicate what we already did elsewhere (security group) to another neutron entity; I didn\u0027t expect to go back to the drawing board on this dependency check feature... ;-) \n\nAnd I do disagree with the apparently increasing general fear :) of doing any DS reads anywhere. (Note also a similar discussion over on https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/74394/.) We never said that we will never ever read anything directly from the DS anymore anywhere and go through caches everywhere. \n\nIn this particular case, I fear the known to not be transactionally atomic datastore cache usage could lead to consistency issues. \n\nTherefore, I\u0027d love to see this move forward as-is. Iff we ever do find real serious performance issues in neutron which we can prove to be related to doing a little read before doing a write, then we revisit this (but I doubt we will). Would that work for you?",

      "message": "I agree with Michael. I think we should KISS and *if* scale testing shows a problem we can work on a solution. Obviously, the rest API can wait a tiny bit more AND even though the read briefly locks the data tree, it\u0027s a branch that does not exactly get a huge amount of action. So, yeah, I say let\u0027s proceed the way it is and if it turns into a problem, we can address it then. Sound good?",
